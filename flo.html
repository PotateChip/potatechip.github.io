Flo Davis, a 20-year-old University student in the year 2026. Most kids her age are always busy doing the odd jobs related to their field of study to gain the experience and credits necessary to advance to the next level, this meant bouncing around from position to position trying out a variety of different things. Most of the classes she was interested in had sponsored learning opportunities so on most days she can cut out of the lecture early and go score a few extra coins with some hoverboard driven cruising and verification, tracking, or delivering.
Flo has lots of choices for what to do, from trout farms to delivery of final finished goods. But, Flo worked out an arrangement with a coffee grower back in Nicaragua when she was there a few years ago as part of the terra growing series she was wrapping up in order to claim her coffee-chain credential. With her credentials as a coffee delivery agent, she was now authorized to pack and brew the highly coveted Nicaraguan coastal beans in the pacific northwest where the beans were highly coveted for their strong burst of sunshine flavor captured over the hot summer months under the blazing sun.  Portland, with it’s dreary, colorless, and overcast falls and winters in particular, could not get enough of these bright and tasty coffees. Therefore, Flo got straight to operating as a coffee deliverer

Chapter 1

 Flo whizzes by on her hoverboard carving through the city streets as the glistening moonlight hastily lights up the urban landscape. Coffee delivery is a tough sport only recommended for the young and athletic, the most advanced AI systems connected to quantum processing chips to calculate the shortest route to deliver any pizza the fastest.  It takes dedication and commitment to be the best, and Flo was known in the city of Ethereum to be the baddest and fastest of all the coffee delivery agents. Getting a delivery on time was more than knowing the quickest routes through the city, and surfing through the streets. It also meant hitching unauthorized rides by grabbing onto other autonomously driven vehicles and getting the data for where these vehicles were going. To feed into the delivery routing algorithm was no easy feat,  Only the best hacker could get this data and feed it into their delivery algorithms to calculate optimal delivery routes.

Flo stalls to a halt just on the porch of the customer. A little boy opened the door expectedly as Flo handed the warm package over to him. The packaging indicating measurements of perfect temperature with a ding sound as the perfect cappuccino finished it’s brewing inside the thermal packaging just that second.

Flo works in the gig economy as a hoverboarding delivery girl of the future, navigating experiences we can all relate to but with new technology at her side.  With an advanced personal assistant like Hero helping Flo, many of the manual wallet interactions in our experiments demo slide into the background, just like an Uber payment. We hope you enjoy this light hearted look at how technology can impact our lives to make it simpler, and sometimes not so simple!

Getting a job is never easy, but to get paid, you gotta have the right skills.  Flo knows this and that’s why she’s on the track to eventually become a doctor. But to be a doctor its going to take many years and earning lots of learning credits, some of these she can get at the school and some of these are available from on the job training like she is doing today.

As a University student she was busy doing the odd jobs related to her field of study to gain the experience credits necessary to advance to the next level.  This meant bouncing around on her summer breaks and picking up positions as varied as placing biometric reading devices on cattle in Wyoming to verifying coffee strains in Central America. During the school year, most of the classes she was interested in had sponsored learning opportunities so on most days she could cut out of the lecture early and go score a few extra coins using her hover board to make deliveries or verify some goods. 

Flo had worked out an exclusive arrangement with a coffee grower back in Nicaragua when she was there a few years ago as part of the terra growing series she was wrapping up in order to claim her coffee-chain credential. With her credential on the coffee-chain as a delivery agent, she was now authorized to pack and brew the highly coveted Nicaraguan coastal beans in the Pacific Northwest where the beans were highly coveted for their strong burst of sunshine flavor captured over the warm summer months under the blazing sun.  Portland, with its dreary and overcast falls and winters in particular could not get enough of these bright and tasty coffees.
On her early morning deliveries before school she whizzed by on her hover board carving through the city streets, the lights sizzling and crackling as they turn and lit a pathway through the urban landscape. Coffee delivery is a tough sport only recommended for the young and athletic with the most advanced AI systems connected to quantum processing chips to calculate the shortest route to deliver any coffee faster than anyone else could.  It takes dedication and commitment to be the best and Flo was known to be the best and fastest of all the coffee delivery agents. Getting a delivery on time was more than knowing the quickest routes through the city. Surfing through the streets also meant hitching unauthorized rides by grabbing onto other autonomously driven vehicles and getting the data for where these vehicles were going to and from in order to feed that data into the delivery routing algorithm.  Only the best hackers could get this data and feed it into their delivery algorithms to calculate optimal delivery routes.
Flo made it to the delivery stop just as the customer was opening their door expectedly as Flo’s handed the warm package over the packaging indicating measurements of perfect temperature with a ding sound as the perfect cappuccino finished it’s brewing inside the thermal packaging just that second.  

Upon delivery the founder says “hey Flo, we’re working on a new product and we really need to secure a supply of these beans.  They’re the only ones that work in the new smart-chocolate that we’re blending up. My investors are running out of capital and we just need to secure another months’ worth.  What do you think you could do?” 

Flo is always on the hunt to make a deal, satisfy her customers and also make more money for her suppliers thereby tightening her relationships up and down the supply chain.  Flo steps outside and speaks to her personal assistant, Hero.  “Hero, can you check the price on Nicaraguan Sunshine contracts through the next 8 weeks? “

Hero tells her “Flo, if you want to secure an 8-week supply that’s going to come at a premium, might I suggest you contact Romeo the coffee grower you worked for last year and see if he can”.  

“See if you can get ahold of Romeo for me Hero, thanks!” asks Flo as she returns back to her customer.  “Peter, I’ll see what I do- you’re one of my best customers and you can always tip well so I’ll do my best!’

“I’ve got Romeo on the line, Flo” interrupts Hero, 

“Hello Romeo I need to secure a 10 pound delivery of those sweet Sunshine Beans for the next 8 weeks.” 

“Flo, nice to see you again – that’s a great order but I’m not able to fulfill 80 pounds right now, it seems that the secret of our sunshine beans is out and we just had an order from Seattle for our entire stock for the next 6 months!”

“Oh No, Romeo, that’s terrible – I wonder if there’s something about these beans than meets the eye.  Romeo, do you have any other ideas, this is for one of my best customers and they’re working on a new chocolate blend that if it takes off will secure orders for the next year and allow you to double your production.”

“Well Flo, I have a new supplier, he’s my nephew from up in the hills high above the Las Flores surf camp in the Eastern part of the country, his beans are magical!  The only problem is that his farm is not yet part of the coffee-chain – his beans have been going through the Brex 360 machine solution and it gets him a fair price but these beans truly are magical!  You have to come down and try them for yourself, you could be the first to certify them for the coffee-chain and have an exclusive distribution rights.”

Flo’s Bank Account is hacked
But, there’s a problem! Her identity has been compromised in her non-modernized account from the Nells Frago, and she needs help securing and restoring her assets and maybe migrating her account. Hero initiates the CitiBank Account Secure, and Recover service from her CitiBank account. Flo also asks Hero for her to be migrated from Nells to CitiBank, and be forgotten and removed from the Nells network and affiliates. With the help of Citiwallet, she’s able to perform a multi-signature account secure and restore and recover her accounts. 

Flo gets a Dog
Flo happens across a stray dog. She does a biometric scan of the dog to see if it has any owners. She is shocked to see it with no digital identification. She can only give the dog an ID, and keep it, with a proper credential. Flo decides to go to an Animal Handling course free, from Citi. With this credential, Flo asks Hero to give the puppy an ID with herself as a registered owner. Hero efficiently handles this for her.

With a new dog Flo named ‘Luna’, she is ready to start work again.

Now Flo and her dog need to make an appointment at the Vet, so the new dog is only allowed to enter the Vet once it has been ID’ed.  We’re able to show the collection of privacy preserving medical records under the guardianship of Flo.
